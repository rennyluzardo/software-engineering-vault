# 🏛️ Software Engineering & Architecture Vault

Welcome to my personal technical vault. This repository is a curated collection of Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), Performance Spikes, and Technical Case Studies derived from over 10 years of experience leading high-scale enterprise applications.

The goal of this vault is to demonstrate not just how I code, but how I think and solve complex engineering challenges at scale.

## 🚀 Featured Case Studies

### 🤖 Agentic Systems: Adaptive-POS Generative UI

**Problem:** Traditional POS interfaces become rigid and hard to maintain when UI behavior depends on real-time inventory, cart state, and user intent.

**Solution:** Designed a generative UI architecture with LangGraph orchestration, zero-hallucination contract validation, and InventoryService as the single source of truth.

**Impact:** Enables dynamic, context-aware interfaces while preserving strict backend/frontend contract consistency and operational reliability.

### 🏗️ System Design: Venti SaaS Architecture

**Problem:** Need for a highly scalable, multi-tenant business management platform with strict data isolation.

**Solution:** Engineered a modular architecture using NestJS and React 19, implementing Row-Level Security (RLS) and tenant-specific contexts.

**Impact:** A production-ready blueprint for secure, concurrent enterprise operations and real-time communications.

### 🍽️ System Design: miPOS — Restaurant OS

**Problem:** High operational friction in the restaurant industry due to siloed delivery apps (Rappi/Uber Eats), isolated POS terminals, and manual inventory sync.

**Solution:** Engineered an API-first "Operating System" console using Next.js and a custom Node.js server to normalize fragmented data into a single, resilient omnichannel interface.

**Impact:** Eliminated manual data re-entry, saving 2–5 minutes per ticket and providing an open API for third-party marketplace integrations.

### 📱 Mobile Engineering: Legacy Resilience

**Problem:** Maintaining high-availability (99.8% uptime) in a mission-critical logistics app running on legacy React Native 0.59.

**Solution:** Strategic implementation of dependency bridges (jetifier), manual native patches, and a phased 4-stage modernization roadmap.

**Impact:** Zero-downtime maintenance of industrial operations while eliminating critical security vulnerabilities.

### ⚡ Frontend: High-Performance Bundle Strategy

**Problem:** Monolithic enterprise platform with a >2MB initial bundle size affecting Core Web Vitals.

**Solution:** Implemented granular code-splitting, tree-shaking optimization, and a dynamic icon registry using Vite 7.

**Impact:** Projected reduction of 60% in initial load time and a +40 point increase in Lighthouse scores.

### 🎨 Frontend: Gestalt UI & Accessible Design

**Problem:** High cognitive load and visual fatigue in data-dense administrative dashboards.

**Solution:** Theme system based on Gestalt Psychology principles and WCAG 2.1 AAA contrast standards.

**Impact:** 6.5:1 contrast ratios and optimized information density for power users.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Patterns

**Frontend:** React 19, Vite 7, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit.

**Backend & System:** NestJS 11, PostgreSQL (RLS), Multi-tenant Architecture.

**Mobile:** React Native (Legacy & Modern), SRE Monitoring Patterns.

**Methodologies:** Atomic Design, Module Federation, Compound Components.
